      "description": "In the photo you're looking at here, I'm talking with 50 survivors of sexual assault who stood onstage with Lady Gaga � who I'm traveling with in Las Vegas today � right after her performance at the Oscars. I stayed and met with each of them. They were so brave. So strong. Just like Lady Gaga herself. She gets it. She has survived it. And there wasn�t a dry eye in the house that night. Everyone in that theatre, and watching from home, had to have felt in that moment that it is truly on ALL of us.

Over the last 25 years, I've been asked a lot why I'm so passionate about the issue of violence against women. Did I know someone, or was someone in my family, God forbid, the victim of one of these horrific crimes? 

Here's the truth. The reason I got engaged in this work is that I was raised by a gentle man -- a decent, honorable man. My father, Joseph R. Biden, Sr. And there was something he'd say to his children and to literally anyone who would listen, for that matter: That the greatest sin anyone could commit was the abuse of power. And the cardinal sin of all sins was when a man raised his hand to a woman or a child or another man who he victimized.

Because sexual assault is not about sex. It's about power. And it's deeply engrained in our culture. On campuses. In communities. In our workplaces. That�s why our work isn't just about protecting women and men from being abused. It's about challenging and actively changing a culture that asks all the wrong questions. Blames the victims. Actually on some level fundamentally tolerates this ugliest of all forms of violence. That is what It's On Us is all about. So one of the first things you can do right now is take the pledge and join this groundswell of young men and women around the country who are standing up and saying: Not on my watch.

Taking it means saying you�ll recognize that non-consensual sex is sexual assault. That you�ll identify situations in which it may occur, and you�ll intervene when consent has not or cannot be given. That you�ll do your part to create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable, and survivors are supported.

Take the pledge now: www.ItsOnUs.org

But beyond that, I want to know what you're doing to change this reality where you live and work. How are you stepping up? How are you actively changing the culture around you?

And it took me a long time to even admit it to myself because I'm Catholic and I knew it was evil but I thought it was my fault. I thought it was my fault for ten years. The morning after the Oscars when I talked to my grandmother Ronnie, with tears in her eyes I could hear them welling through the phone she said to me \"My darling granddaughter, I've never been more proud of you than I am today.\" Something I have kept a secret for so long that I was more ashamed of than anything-- became the thing the women in my life were the most proud of. And not just any women, the ones I look up to the most. #BeBrave #speakup #tilithappenstoyou",

The whole night before I did not sleep. The fear of knowing I would finally face that I belonged in that group. I told them I was so sorry I couldn't be Lady Gaga for them, that I couldn't even get dressed. I could barely get through the song, couldn't hit any of the high notes. Hair wet, sloppy tee shirt jeans uggs, tissues. They all hugged me and told me that it was okay because it was more real this way, that they understood that they were in pain too. They told me they were there for me to support me because they believed this message needed to be heard. Without them I never could have felt strong. They accepted me for me, at my lowest and that was good enough for them, so somehow through the magic of their courage they made it good enough for me too.",
