They discussed NASA missions studying changes in the Earth’s atmosphere, water and land masses for a climate change documentary DiCaprio has in production.
 
Using Goddard’s Hyperwall high-definition display system, they viewed presentations based on actual science data captured by NASA’s fleet of satellites orbiting Earth, as well as climate and ocean-current modeling done by the NASA Center for Climate Simulation at Goddard. 
 
Mr. DiCaprio also viewed the clean room where the next-generation James Webb Space Telescope is being developed.

In September, the United Nations launched 17 Sustainable Development Goals with the objectives of ending extreme poverty and fighting inequality. Every one of those goals is linked to climate change. This December, as world leaders meet in Paris to negotiate a climate deal, they must take bold steps to build a better future for us all.

Spending millions of dollars on misleading ads and lobbying that instead could have been invested in clean transportation fuels, the oil industry prevailed in part through deceptive tactics to which we have grown accustomed. 

While we won't have #SB350 to do the job, we do still have #AB32, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Clean Cars Program, Zero Emission Vehicle program, and other clean energy policies that will propel California forward to reduce its petroleum use, hold polluters accountable and continue our transition to cleaner fuels and transportation options. 

Calling all Californians: please call your state representative TODAY and ask for their support of #SB32.

California Environmental Justice Alliance members announce support for Senate Bill  32
 
The California Environmental Justice Alliance and its member organizations, joined by Assembly Member Sebastian Ridley-Thomas and Sen. Fran Pavley, will call on lawmakers and the governor to pass Senate Bill 32. Other attendees backing SB 32 include Assembly Members Christina Garcia and Tony Thurmond.
 
The Alliance represents over 20,000 residents of low income communities and communities of color, who suffer disproportionately from living near highways, ports, refineries, factories and other sources of pollution.
 
A recent Public Policy Institute of California poll shows a solid majority of Californians believe the effects of global warming “have already begun to happen.” Those sentiments particularly are strong among Latinos, 73%, Asians, 59%, and Blacks 54%. Another recent poll by CEJA and partners found that 79 percent of Latinos think it is important that the state government address climate change.
 
Sen. Pavley’s SB 32 deepens and extends her landmark AB 32 law of 2006. The nine-year-old measure created a framework for reducing climate pollution emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The new legislation, awaiting debate and a vote on the floor of the state Assembly this week, will lock into statute 2030 and 2050 climate pollution cuts ordered by Gov. Jerry Brown and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
 
“SB 32 takes bold steps needed to address this public health, economic and environmental crisis,” the Environmental Justice Alliance wrote in a letter of support to Sen. Pavley…”SB 32 helps not only meet the challenge of climate change, but also takes important steps to directly improve the air quality and health of communities most overburdened by pollution.”",
